        "TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) is a library for exploring and validating machine learning data. It is designed to be highly scalable and to work well with TensorFlow and TensorFlow Extended (TFX).\n",

        "+ Compute summary statistics for train/test/validation data in a scalable way. While `scikit-learn` is limited to datasets which fit into RAM, this is not a concern for TFDV.\n",

        "+ Automatic schema inference \n",
        "+ Schema generation includes description of expectations about data (like required values, ranges, and vocabularies)\n",
        "+ A schema viewer to help you inspect the schema\n",
        "+ Anomaly detection to identify anomalies (missing features, out-of-range values, or wrong feature types)\n",
        "+ An anomalies viewer to see which features have anomalies\n",
        "+ TFDV can help validate new data for inference to ensure no bad features are processed\n",
        "+ TFDV can help validate that your model has been trained on part of the decision surface for new data during inference \n",
        "+ TFDV can help validate data after it's been transformed by TF Transform to ensure nothing unexpected has occurred to the data\n",
